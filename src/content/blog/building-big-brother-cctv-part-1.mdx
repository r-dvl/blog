  Work in progress! This is the first part of a series on building a home CCTV system using Kubernetes and microservices. Stay tuned for more updates!

## Intro and Design

### What’s this about?

Whenever I go on trips, I always worry about what my cats are up to at home. So, I wanted a DIY CCTV setup that’s flexible, scalable, and something I can fully control. That’s how __Big Brother CCTV__ was born — a home surveillance system built with __microservices__, __containers__, and __Kubernetes__ that lets me keep an eye on my furry friends from anywhere.

### What gear am I using?

Here’s the setup:

- A __ZimaBoard__ running _Proxmox VE_, with a _Debian_ VM inside that hosts _Kubernetes_ via _k3s_ — this is my main cluster node.

- Plus, a __Raspberry Pi 3B+__ equipped with a __PiCamera__ also running _k3s_ as a worker node to expand the cluster and keep things connected.

Everything lives inside a single _Kubernetes_ _namespace_, and the services talk to each other over the cluster’s internal network — so it’s fast and secure.

### Why Kubernetes and microservices?

I picked Kubernetes because:

- It scales easily — add more nodes or cameras without hassle.

- It’s resilient — services restart if something crashes.

- Helm makes deploying and updating a breeze.

- Each piece runs isolated in containers, so it’s easier to maintain and upgrade.

> The whole system is split into _microservices_, each doing its own job but working together to keep things smooth.

### How the system works
![Design](/blog/images/big-brother-cctv-design.svg)

#### Main parts:

- __Camera__: A _Docker_ _container_ running an ffmpeg script that grabs the camera feed and streams it.

- __Media Server__: Handles _RTSP/RTMP_ streams, taking in video from ffmpeg and serving it out to clients.

- __API__: Cameras register themselves on startup by posting their config to a _PostgreSQL_ DB, and of course for user auth. I am going to use _Java Springboot_ for this one.

- __Frontend__: A simple interface to watch streams, manage cameras, and check system status. I thought about _React_, but I'm going to use _Angular_. I think it integrates best with _Java Springboot_ (in my humble opinion).

#### Basic flow

- __Cameras__ (or ffmpeg containers pretending to be cameras) start up and register via the API.

- Ffmpeg grabs the video feed and sends it to __Media Server__.

- __Media Server__ distributes streams to connected clients, like the __Frontend__.

- I can check on my cats live and manage cameras from the web and change __Cameras__ configuration.

- __Cameras__ will be polling to fetch most recent configuration (or maybe a hook on Cameras listening for new configuration when this changes).

### Why build this?

Honestly, it started as a fun personal project to learn _Kubernetes_ and _microservices_ — but with a practical twist: keeping an eye on my cats while I’m away. The setup is pretty flexible and could be adapted for any home or small business CCTV needs.
